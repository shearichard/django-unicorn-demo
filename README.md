# Unicorn Demo

A demo of the django unicorn project.

As per the project's README ... *Unicorn adds modern reactive component functionality to your Django templates without having to learn a new templating language or fight with complicated JavaScript frameworks. It seamlessly extends Django past its server-side framework roots without giving up all of its niceties or forcing you to rebuild your application. With Django Unicorn, you can quickly and easily add rich front-end interactions to your templates, all while using the power of Django.*
